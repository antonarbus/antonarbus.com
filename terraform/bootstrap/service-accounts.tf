# ==============================================================================
# SHARED SERVICE ACCOUNTS
# ==============================================================================
# These service accounts are shared across ALL environments (dev, test, pilot, prod)
# They are created once in bootstrap and referenced by all environment workspaces
#
# WHY IN BOOTSTRAP?
# - Service accounts are singleton resources (one per project)
# - Multiple environments (workspaces) would conflict if trying to create the same SA
# - Bootstrap runs once, infrastructure runs per environment
# ==============================================================================

# ==============================================================================
# SERVICE ACCOUNT FOR GITHUB ACTIONS
# ==============================================================================
# Shared across all environments (dev, test, pilot, prod)
# One service account can deploy to any environment
# Simplifies credential management - one GitHub Secret for all

# IAM PERMISSIONS (Principle of Least Privilege)

# Cloud Run: Full management including domain mappings

# Required for automated domain mapping creation via Terraform
